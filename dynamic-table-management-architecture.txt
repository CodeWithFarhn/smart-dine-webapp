ReserveEase
Dynamic Table Booking Logic & Restaurant Management Architecture
Logic Review and Recommendations Report
1. Purpose of This Report

This report evaluates the logical architecture behind ReserveEase’s dynamic table booking system, with a focus on:

Restaurant onboarding and data collection

Table availability and assignment logic

Concurrency and booking conflicts

The necessity of a Restaurant Management Panel

Separation of responsibilities between customer-facing and owner-facing flows

The report intentionally ignores implementation details and focuses strictly on system logic, responsibilities, and correctness.

2. Current Registration Flow: Logical Evaluation
Existing Pages

Currently, the system includes:

Restaurant Registration (Multi-step form)
Collects:

Basic restaurant identity

Location & contact details

General operating hours

These pages serve as initial onboarding, not full configuration.

Logical Strengths

✔ Progressive disclosure reduces friction

✔ Captures immutable or rarely changing data

✔ Allows restaurant to appear on platform quickly

Logical Limitations

The registration flow does not and should not handle:

Table configurations

Booking rules

Availability policies

Seating constraints

Reservation management

Menu / recipes

Dynamic business decisions

Conclusion:
Registration ≠ Operations
Onboarding ≠ Management

Trying to push booking logic into registration would overload onboarding and increase abandonment.

3. Need for a Restaurant Panel (Critical)
Logical Necessity

A Restaurant Panel (Dashboard) is not optional — it is architecturally required.

Why?

Because:

Booking logic depends on mutable business rules

Restaurants need ongoing control, not one-time input

Many booking decisions are contextual and time-dependent

Without a restaurant panel:

Booking logic becomes rigid

Owners lose trust

System cannot adapt to real-world operations

4. Logical Responsibilities of the Restaurant Panel
4.1 Booking & Reservation Management

The restaurant must be able to:

View upcoming reservations

Accept / reject / cancel bookings

Block tables manually

Handle walk-ins and overrides

Logic principle:
The restaurant is the final authority on seating reality.

4.2 Table & Seating Logic Configuration

All logic that affects how tables are assigned belongs in the panel, not registration.

This includes:

Total tables and seating capacity

Table types (booth, window, bar, etc.)

Merge rules (which tables can combine)

Priority tables

Sections (main hall, outdoor, private)

Key Logic Insight:
Table geometry is not booking logic.
Capacity, grouping, and constraints are.

4.3 Orphan Seat & Partial Booking Policies

Restaurants must define:

Whether underfilled tables are allowed

When warnings are shown

Whether restrictions apply during peak hours

Preferences for exact-fit vs over-capacity seating

These rules change over time and cannot be hardcoded.

4.4 Operating Hours & Availability Rules

The registration page collects general hours, but booking logic requires:

Per-day time slots

Reservation duration rules

Peak vs off-peak definitions

Blackout dates

Event-based overrides

This data must live in a management panel, not onboarding.

4.5 Menu / Recipes / Listings (Optional but Logical)

Allowing restaurants to manage:

Menu items or recipes

Specials

Featured dishes

While not required for booking logic, this:

Increases restaurant engagement

Enhances customer decision-making

Aligns with restaurant ownership of content

5. Table Assignment Logic: Conceptual Model
Core Logical Principle

Availability is temporal, not spatial

Tables themselves are static.
Reservations block time ranges, not objects permanently.

Assignment Strategy (Logical Order)

Exact-fit tables

Mergeable combinations

Acceptable over-capacity tables (with rules)

Fallback or rejection

Orphan Seats

Should be handled with soft constraints

Percentage-based rules alone are insufficient

Must consider:

Party size

Table size

Time slot demand

Owner preferences

6. Real-Time Concurrency: Logical Requirements
Problem

Multiple users may attempt to book the same table at the same time.

Correct Logical Solution

Server-side authority

Temporary table holds

Time-limited locks

Instant state propagation

Key Logical Rules

Clients are never trusted

Locks are ephemeral

Reservations are durable

Availability is recalculated, not stored as static state

7. Separation of Concerns (Very Important)
Area	Responsibility
Registration Pages	Identity & visibility
Restaurant Panel	Operational control
Booking Engine	Decision logic
Database	Source of truth
Real-time Layer	Synchronization

Violating this separation leads to:

Overloaded forms

Fragile logic

Poor scalability

Owner frustration

8. Recommended High-Level Architecture Flow

Restaurant registers

Minimal required data

Restaurant appears on platform

Marked as “Setup Incomplete”

Owner accesses Restaurant Panel

Configures tables

Sets booking rules

Defines availability

Booking logic becomes active

Dynamic, rule-driven

Real-time safe

9. Final Conclusion

Yes, a Restaurant Panel page is logically mandatory

Registration pages should remain lightweight

All dynamic booking logic must be configurable post-registration

Table booking correctness depends on:

Owner-controlled rules

Temporal availability

Server-side authority

Geometry and visuals are secondary to capacity and policy logic

Core Architectural Principle

Onboarding collects identity.
Management defines reality.
Logic enforces fairness and efficiency.
